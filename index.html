                            My name is Oluwafemi Oyedeji. I was born in Lagos, 
                            Southwestern part of Nigeria. I graduated with a
                            degree in electrical engineering from Poma International
                            Business University, Benin. Right from the time I was a 
                            teenager, I played with computers a lot as my hobby,
                            my passion, and my way of learning. Like most kids I enjoyed 
                            computer games. When my uncle gave me a computer as a reward
                            for making honor roll in my fourth year at high school, 
                            I mastered DOS, Windows, and WordPerfect within six months.
                            I then went on to teach myself programming basics.</p> <br>
                
                        <p>Also, in my second year at college I took two programming
                            classes in which I had an Aâ€™s. From then I developed a 
                            lot of interest in computer science and which to develop 
                            my career in that direction. I am currently enrolled at
                            the boot camp coding program at the University of Minnesota
                            to enable me achieving my dream of becoming a professional
                            software engineer where I will have the opportunity to 
                            qualify for numerous computing jobs. At the completion of 
                            this program, I would have acquired the necessary technical
                            know-how needed to build my own web and mobile applications
                            which is my ultimate goal. </p>
